# RESTful-API
# Course Management API

A simple RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js that allows users to manage a list of courses. The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and uses Joi for input validation.

 Features

- Get All Courses: Retrieve a list of all courses.
- Get Course by ID: Fetch details of a specific course.
- Add a Course: Create a new course (with validation to ensure the course name is at least 3 characters long).
- Update a Course: Modify an existing course.
- Delete a Course: Remove a course from the list.

 Tech Stack

- Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building the API.
- Express.js – Web framework for handling routes and middleware.
- Joi – Validation library to enforce request schema.
- NPM – Package manager for dependencies.
